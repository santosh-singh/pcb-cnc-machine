# pcb-cnc-machine
PCB CNC Milling Project with desktop application, Marlin based Arduino controller &amp; Chinese Milling machine. The objective of the project is to provide detailed instructions to help a new hobbyist in setting up a complete PCB Prototyping system from start.
I started this project and came across multitude of challenges due to various parts being available from various sources. This project will hopefully help you setup your own PCB Milling machine.
